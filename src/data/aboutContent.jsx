          The Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) is the nodal agency of the
          government of Kerala for promoting entrepreneurship in the state. It
          is also the implementing body for the Kerala Technology Startup Policy
          that supports the state's startup ecosystem through the various
          schemes and support programs. KSUM was founded in 2006, with the goal
          to promote technology-based entrepreneurship activities and to create
          the infrastructure and ecosystem required to support high-end
          technology-based startup businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          KSUM acts as a springboard for budding entrepreneurs who wish to
          launch themselves into the world of technology-based careers and has
          helped develop several innovative products and solutions. Over the
          past decade KSUM has been able to build a vibrant startup ecosystem
          allowing technology entrepreneurs to pursue their goals and dreams by
          providing them complete support in the startup life cycle. Today KSUM
          along with sector-specific partner organisations, boast of 6200+
          registered startups, 10 Lakh+ sq. feet of incubation space, 60+
          incubators and 525+ mini incubation centres across the state of
          Kerala.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interventions made by KSUM in Kerala have brought about a cultural
          change among the youth of Kerala, as well as in how the government
          goes about its work. Young minds who come up with innovative solutions
          now have the support of various incubators and government schemes as
          highlighted earlier, which not only help in bringing funding but also
          provide mentorship and expansion opportunities at different stages.
          This approach of the government enables startups to entrepreneurs to
          get ample opportunities to collaborate with the support infrastructure
          to develop impactful technology solutions.
